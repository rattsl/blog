## Why write this article?
When I was learn Programming on udemy, [the course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WB6AEMZc1tQQHgH/) shares some of the most useful tips that will help me learn to code. so, I decided to share and write this article.

## Why write in English?
I thought it would be better if I could study both English and technology at the same time. Even if you notice that my grammer is wrong, please miss it.

## Summary

* Stop video at around the 10 minutes mark.

* If you find that it's a little bit difficult, you should bookmarking it.

## Stop video at around the 10 minutes mark.
You cannot get coding power just by looking at code. It's important for programmer to write code. If you study programming to watch video, try keep up with the pace of the tutorial, and if you had a hard time following that tutorial, pause the video every so often to catch up. While stopping the video, spending time that try to type out the code frantically is important, but it's better to think **why the code is being written** and **understanding the purpose of the code**. 10 minutes is for that.

## Use the Cornell Note Talking System.
