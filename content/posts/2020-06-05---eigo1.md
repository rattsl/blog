## Statement

You're working so hard. When you're thinking things negatively, it's difficult to realize that you're working so hard.
But actually it takes more enegy to think negatively.
So see? You're working hard. You don't have to think about it as something meaningless. It's rather a meaningful thing.
You went through those bumps, but you'll see another sunshine.
